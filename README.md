Locked-In is a visually engaging Pomodoro timer application built with SvelteKit. It helps you manage work and break sessions effectively using the Pomodoro Technique, while providing a relaxing, customizable background.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app helps you implement that technique easily.

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Classic Pomodoro Workflow:** Easily switch between Work, Short Break, and Long Break sessions.
*   **Customizable Timer:** Adjust the duration (in minutes) for:
    *   Work sessions
    *   Short breaks
    *   Long breaks
*   **Session Management:** Configure how many work sessions occur before a longer break is triggered.
*   **Dynamic Gradient Background:** Enjoy a beautiful, subtly shifting background gradient.
    *   **HSL Color Controls:** Use sliders to precisely control the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness for both gradient color stops. A preview box shows the current color and HSL values.
    *   **Color History:** Easily cycle back and forth through your recent color choices for each gradient stop using the arrow buttons.
    *   **Randomize:** Get inspired with randomly generated colors using the sparkle button. ‚ú®
    *   **Controlled Auto-Cycle:** Toggle an option for each color to automatically and slowly drift towards new random HSL values over time, keeping the background fresh without being distracting.
*   **Subtle Floating Effect:** A gentle animation makes the main timer panel appear to "float" (can be toggled on/off).
*   **Unified Settings Panel:** Access all timer and background customization options conveniently in one slide-out panel.
*   **Persistent Settings:** Your preferences for timer durations and background colors are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so they'll be there when you return.
*   **Modern Tech:** Built with SvelteKit and the latest Svelte 5 features (Runes) for a reactive and efficient experience.

## How to Use ü§î

1.  **Start the Timer:** Click the "Start" button to begin a work session.
2.  **Focus:** Work until the timer rings.
3.  **Take a Break:** The timer will automatically suggest the appropriate break (short or long). Click "Start" to begin the break timer.
4.  **Customize (Optional):**
    *   Click the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.
    *   Adjust **Timer Settings** like work/break durations.
    *   Explore **Background Effects**:
        *   Use the HSL sliders or history buttons to change the gradient colors.
        *   Try the "Randomize" button.
        *   Enable "Auto-Cycle" for one or both colors.
        *   Toggle the "Enable floating effect?".
        *   Click "Reset to Defaults" to restore the original background settings.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue the work/break cycles!
